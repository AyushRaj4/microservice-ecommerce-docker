Docker Compose is an important tool to save us writing long commands in terminal as well as creating multiple containers

Commands
1. docker compose up -d
2. docker compose start -d
3. docker compose stop
4. docker compose down -v
5. docker compose up -d --build
6. docker volume prune -f
7. docker compose -f docker-compose.dev/prod.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d --build
8. docker compose -f docker-compose.dev/prod.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down
9. docker exec -it comtainer-name /bin/mongosh -u "username" -p "password"

What they do?
1. runs the docker-compose file and creates the image(only 1st time) and container(also runs it)
2. runs an already existing container
3. stops a running container
4. stops and removes the container created through docker-compose, -v also removes associated volumes
5. the image builds only the 1st time when using docker-compose, to rebuild it use the --build tag
6. remove unused/anonymous volumes, i.e. volumes that are not attached to any containers
7. runs the default docker compose file and the docker compose dev or prod file and creates container
8. stops the default docker compose file and the docker compose dev or prod file and removes the container
9. shortcut to enter mongodb bash using credentialsf
